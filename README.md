## Concordanator
A Java based applicaton/library for creating concordances of texts and searching said concordances.

#### What is a concordance might, you ask?
A concordance is a list of words appearing in a work, with line numbers for each occurrence. That's basically it.

#### Why is this useful?
Ask me that question again later and I might have a good answer for you.

#### Using with netbeans:
1. Clone the repo or switch to the master branch and `git pull origin master` to update.
2. Create a new netbeans project in a separate directory from where you cloned the repo.
3. Select create project from existing sources.
4. Follow the prompts and add the src and test folder from the repo as sources for the project.
5. finish

Now you should have a working netbeans project. Git actions will need to be made from the repo dir.

### Building from the command line with javac
1. `cd` into the root dir of the project.
2. execute java -cp build Main
3. that's it.


#### General Todo:
1. Document all the things.
2. Come up with more todos.
